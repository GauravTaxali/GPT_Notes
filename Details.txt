GPT (GUID Partitioning Table) is a partitioning scheme built to manage storage devices. It can create 128 partitions.

1. Protective MBR: This section is located at the very beginning of the disk and serves the following purposes:
i. It exists for compatibility with legacy systems that don't understand GPT.
ii. Contains a single partition entry that spans the entire disk, marking it as in-use, so older tools don’t overwrite GPT disks by mistake.

2. Primary GPT Header: The Primary GPT Header is critical metadata about the disk and partitions. It includes:
i. Disk GUID: A unique identifier for the entire disk.
ii. Pointer to the Partition Entry Array: A reference indicating where the partition table begins.
iii. Checksum (CRC32): Ensures the integrity of the header data and allows detection of corruption.
iv. Backup GPT Header Location: Identifies the location of the backup header at the end of the disk.

3. Partition Entry Array (Primary): The Partition Entry Array contains detailed information about each partition on the disk. Key details stored here include:
i. Partition Type GUID: Specifies the type of partition (e.g., EFI System Partition, Linux Filesystem, etc.).
ii. Partition GUID: A unique identifier for the specific partition.
iii. Starting and Ending Addresses: Defines the location of the partition on the disk.
iv. Attributes: Flags for the partition (e.g., bootable, hidden).
v. The number of entries in the array varies by operating system but is typically 128 entries on Windows.

4. User Data: This is the actual storage space allocated for files and applications. Each partition stores its data here, and the system uses the file system (e.g., NTFS, FAT32, EXT4) for organizing the data within partitions.

5. Backup Partition Entry Array: The Backup Partition Entry Array mirrors the primary array to ensure redundancy and data recovery. It’s stored near the end of the disk, providing an alternative in case the primary array is damaged.

6. Backup GPT Header: Located at the very end of the disk, the Backup GPT Header is a replica of the primary GPT header. Its role is to:
i. Facilitate recovery by providing key disk metadata.
ii. Verify integrity with its own CRC32 checksum.
iii. Restore corrupted data from the backup partition table.


The official 5 parts of GPT are:
1. Protective MBR: Used in the case when the partition is GPT, then the MBR sector 0 is filled with zeroes, the partition table has the bytes
